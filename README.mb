# The Climate Cost of Food: Linking Emissions to Agricultural Sustainability üåç

In this project, we focus on the impacts of dietary preferences, carbon emissions, and climate change on future agricultural productivity by analyzing the relationships between these factors.

## Objectives
1. **Evaluate the Environmental Impact of Dietary Preferences:**
   - Determine how different food preferences contribute to CO2 emissions.
   - Answer questions such as whether meat consumption or a vegetable-heavy diet leads to more carbon emissions.

2. **Assess the Role of CO2 Emissions in Climate Change:**
   - Explore the extent to which CO2 emissions drive global warming and, consequently, climate change.

3. **Examine Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture:**
   - Address the projected effects of climate change on crop yields and agricultural systems.
   - Highlight the large-scale environmental consequences of individual food preferences.

## Project Outcomes
By analyzing these factors, this project aims to:
- Raise awareness of the environmental costs associated with dietary choices.
- Highlight the interconnectedness of food systems, carbon emissions, and climate change.
- Support sustainable agricultural practices for a more environmentally responsible future.
