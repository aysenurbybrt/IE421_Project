# Nutritional Preferences and Carbon Footprint 🌍
This project looks at how what people eat affects carbon emissions and how these choices relate to the planet’s health. It plans to assess the environmental outcomes of eating meat and the patterns of meat consumption globally and individually. It will explore how people’s food choices influence carbon emissions and environmental health, how different countries produce meat, the trends that appear over time, and how nations with high levels of meat production add to carbon emissions and what this means for environmental health.
